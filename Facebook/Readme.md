Note: @davitmk added the PreservePackageXmLinkFile.cs file to preserve the link.xml file located in the package. This is because Unity ignores link.xml files that are located in packages.


Installation:
Open the Unity Package Manager and add from git url "https://github.com/Davidnovarro/Unity-Packages.git?path=/Facebook/17.0.1/package"
